> :books: A project documentation setup tool

## Background

The _skan-docs_ CLI tool can automate the documentation setup process for your project.  Running _skan-docs_ will download and install docsify-cli, skan-convert, serve, remark-lint, remark-cli, jsdoc, jsdoc plugins, react-styleguidist and npm-run-all via npm. It will also copy a set of template files into your `docs/` directory and add the `docs` and `lint` commands to your `package.json` so that you can quickly get your project documentation up and running.

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) for more details.
